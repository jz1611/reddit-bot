Every Weekend, the best players compete in 3v3 Elimination for one goal: Go Flawless.\n\n * To start, head to Saint-14 in the Tower Hangar and buy one of the possible passages (see below).\n\n * To reach Flawless and get to the Lighthouse, you need to win 7 matches without losing one.\n\n * It uses Win Based Matchmaking, which means you'll face teams with a similar amount of wins on their card. Matches will get harder as you win more matches.\n\n * There is NO fireteam matchmaking. You need to team up yourself!\n\n * Power Level matters, however bonus power from the artifact is not enabled.\n\n###How Long do the Trials of Osiris last?\n\n * Event Starts: Every Friday at Daily Reset (1700 UTC).\n\n * Event Ends: Following Tuesday at Weekly Reset (1700 UTC).\n\n###Where do I go to find Guardians to compete with in the Trials?\n\n * You can head over to /r/Fireteams, www.The100.io, Xbox LFG system, DestinyLFG.net or DestinyLFG.com, or go to the Bungie.net recruitment forum (also available through the Bungie App).\n\n###What if I have a question about another piece of armor/weapon or general Trials question?\n\n * Use Control + F (Or Command + F if on a Mac) and search for keywords in your question.

I would like to start with a positive and say that I believe the only reason this game is active right now is because of the brilliantly crafted and created with much love shooting experience the game has. The day to day mechanics are a big reason why I play. The gun fighting is simply just fun. \n\nNow, I know it's been posted over and over again, but I'd to list my personal play experience whenever I login. When I read this list it looks like a truly boring gaming experiences today, in my opinion of course.\n\nWait 5 minutes to login\n\nGo to tower.\n\nRun to get Banshee bounties.\n\nRun to get Shaxx bounties\n\nRun to get Zavala bounties\n\nRun to get Gambit bounties\n\nTravel to the moon to get bounties\n\nclear the bunker in 5 minutes\n\nclear the legendary in 10 minutes\n\ngo play crucible and not play how I'd like to because I have bounties to do... again.\n\ngo play gambit and not play how I'd like to because I have bounties to do... again.\n\ngo play nightmare hunts and not play how I'd like to because I have bounties to do... again\n\nfinallby complete whisper because it's one of the few quests that 1. I have the time to complete and 2. is soloable.\n\nthen I'll finally hit up strikes. Strikes are some of the most mine numbingly dull gaming experiences I've ever had. ever. I loathe doing them because they havent been truly updated since day 1 over 4 years ago. It's not a mindset of \"oh I need to play strikes real quick. I'm glad they're adding **at least one every 6 months of a year** since we're paying each quarter for content and a larger purchase every year. \n\nthen I travel to Eververse to look at the coolest stuff I'd love to have the most, but will never pay $8 for a finisher or or $15 for a set of ornaments. $2 for a projection or $4 for an emote. Which is quite insulting players that have been dedicated fanboy/fangirls since day one, during times when you had zero business having any. We're not asking for free new shit, but adding some things in from a couple seasons back would be nice. Charging for content 6 months old is kind scummy. \n\nIs this your vision that set out to create? I can't imagine you're at all happy with the state of the game. Creating a single activity and changing around some difficulties while simultaneously put activity specific conent, even cosmetic, behind a paywall when the geear that is awarded is paltry at best.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I believe a lot of other people do as well. D1Y1 player. I would like to start with a positive and say that I believe the only reason this game is active right now is because of the brilliantly crafted and created with much love shooting experience the game has. The day to day mechanics are a big reason why I play. The gun fighting is simply just fun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I know it&amp;#39;s been posted over and over again, but I&amp;#39;d to list my personal play experience whenever I login. When I read this list it looks like a truly boring gaming experiences today, in my opinion of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait 5 minutes to login&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to tower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run to get Banshee bounties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run to get Shaxx bounties&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run to get Zavala bounties&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run to get Gambit bounties&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Travel to the moon to get bounties&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;clear the bunker in 5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;clear the legendary in 10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;go play crucible and not play how I&amp;#39;d like to because I have bounties to do... again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;go play gambit and not play how I&amp;#39;d like to because I have bounties to do... again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;go play nightmare hunts and not play how I&amp;#39;d like to because I have bounties to do... again&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;finallby complete whisper because it&amp;#39;s one of the few quests that 1. I have the time to complete and 2. is soloable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then I&amp;#39;ll finally hit up strikes. Strikes are some of the most mine numbingly dull gaming experiences I&amp;#39;ve ever had. ever. I loathe doing them because they havent been truly updated since day 1 over 4 years ago. It&amp;#39;s not a mindset of &amp;quot;oh I need to play strikes real quick. I&amp;#39;m glad they&amp;#39;re adding &lt;strong&gt;at least one every 6 months of a year&lt;/strong&gt; since we&amp;#39;re paying each quarter for content and a larger purchase every year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then I travel to Eververse to look at the coolest stuff I&amp;#39;d love to have the most, but will never pay $8 for a finisher or or $15 for a set of ornaments. $2 for a projection or $4 for an emote. Which is quite insulting players that have been dedicated fanboy/fangirls since day one, during times when you had zero business having any. We&amp;#39;re not asking for free new shit, but adding some things in from a couple seasons back would be nice. Charging for content 6 months old is kind scummy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this your vision that set out to create? I can&amp;#39;t imagine you&amp;#39;re at all happy with the state of the game. Creating a single activity and changing around some difficulties while simultaneously put activity specific conent, even cosmetic, behind a paywall when the geear that is awarded is paltry at best. And not even new I might add.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a point, almost 6 years in, where I can&amp;#39;t continue playing this game knowing the way we&amp;#39;re being taken advantage of.

That's a well known fact and something that gets repeated here daily with no changes for our benefit in sight. So, with that in mind, let's just say that the **~1200 BD** price range seems \"fair\" for most of the items sold under that category. \n\n\nExotic Armor Ornaments being a tad bit more expensive than their Legendary counterparts is okay with me given their status. What I'm *not* okay with is shelling out almost **3000 BD** for a Ghost *and then* half of that price again for a Ghost Projection. These two items are ridiculously overpriced, not just compared to the other more useful/visible items in the store, but on their own as well.\n\nYou are paying **4250 BD** for a Ghost and a Projection to go with it. This is more BD than it's even possible to earn per week even if you grind it out on all 3 characters - provided you even have/play them. That little pixel smudge that you're only ever going to see in your inventory and the projection that you're *almost never* going to see cost more than Weapon and Armor Ornaments that you'll use and reuse daily. There is no reason an Exotic Ghost should cost more than **1000 BD** or that projections should cost more than **200-500 BD** depending on how detailed they are. \n\nI don't want people to think I'm advocating for making Shaders more expensive, cause I'm not, but those darn things cost *only* **40 BD**. There's not a single person who can't afford those and they are arguably your most used/reused Eververse items. So, why does a borderline useless Ghost-Projection combo cost more than **100x** the price of a shader? Another comparison is Transmat Effects. They're neat, unique and usually stand out. What do they have in common with Shaders? They're properly priced for what they do.\n\n\n\nOther items that need pricing adjustment are Exotic Emotes (almost 3x the price of their Legendary counterparts at **3250 BD**) and Ships and Sparrows. Unless you *really* like to visit planetary destinations daily, you really won't get that much use out of your Sparrow other than having a neat (if sometimes distracting) decoration in your inventory. There's not that much to be said about Ships, but **2000 BD** is pushing it for me considering you're essentially buying a customized loading screen since Ships have no other purpose.",

          "selftext": "Something I always notice when I'm inspecting the enemy team in high stakes PvP matches is that not many people pay much attention to their stats and armour perks. It often happens with both teammates and enemy team, so I thought I'd explain how to better optimize your armour sets for PvP.\n\nThis will obviously work for PvE aswell, but you'll notice the difference way more in PvP.\n\nTo begin with, I'm Italian, so english isn't my first language.\n\nI'm a console player, Unbroken, and have gone flawless multiple times in the last 3 weeks.  \nI know it's not a big deal to some, but I'm highly invested into PvP even if I'm not a streamer or someone who does recovs / carries 24/7.\n\nI'd say I'm above average, I end most of my games with a positive KD and in high stakes PvP I focus more on winning the match than on padding my stats.  \nHere are my stats if you're curious:\n\n [https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/xbl/Pino%20Show/overview](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/xbl/Pino%20Show/overview) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, to get to the topic of my post: if you open Destiny Item Manager and log in your account you'll notice that there's an option called [Loadout Optimizer](https://imgur.com/a/GofCacU). \n\nClicking on it will bring you to [this page](https://imgur.com/a/5GYYYTS). Here you can look through your characters, and DIM will do it's best to show you the best armour combinations to reach the highest ammount of stats possible.\n\nThis won't take into account the mods you have on your armour. This is extremely important. You'll only see the stats that your gear has by default. If an armour piece is masterworked then the +2 to all stats will be counted into the total splits.\n\nAs you can see my warlock has a set with a T31 split, meaning I have 31 stats point. As in game every 1 point is one level in one of the stats.\n\nI'd recommend to also check the box labelled as Assume Masterworked. This will show you all your best items. It's especially useful if you need to decide what to masterwork next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're not done yet. On the \"drag items here to lock\" you can select an existing piece of armour to lock, and DIM will show you all the best items to go with it. This is especially useful to build around exotic armour, as you'd probably have better stats splitted legendary armour, meaning many exotics might not show up in your highest tier builds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a loadout selected we can no go to the next step: stat mods!  \nThese are what you'll use to min max your stats. \n\nSome are of course more desirable than others: Recovery, Intellect and Discipline especially.  \nHere's where you'll have to make your choices. What stats do you think are most important to you? What build are you using?  \n\n\nArc web warlocks will want as much discipline as possible.  \nDragon's shadow hunters will be happy with 50 mobility, so they can spec eerywhere else.  \nA Kepri's Sting build might want more strength than others.\n\nDon't forget about the Powerful Friends mod from Season of Dawn for a 20+ mobility when paired with another arc mod (and it's glitched status ;) ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that it's time to focus on the other 2 important aspects: elemental affinity and mods. These go hand in hand and it's really up to you. Being able to change the element on the armour means that you can now make your best pieces the element you want.\n\nDepending on your weapon of choice you'll need to go with an element. General mods usually aren't worth it that much. I'm saing usually becasue there's one that's better than all of them in my opinion: Special Weapon Scavenger. This is a boots mod that allows you to keep the same pair of boots regardless of special weapon. \n\nIt's a 4 cost mod though, meaning that if you also are addicted to Traction (like me), you will be pidgeon holed in a 3 cost mod for your boots, *and that's only if you masterwork them!*  \n\n\nAfter that targeting mods on helmets, reload on gauntlets and unflinching on chest are what you'll be looking for after. Remember to take a look at the seasonal mods aswell, since they're tipeless and usually cost less than their normal counterparts. Though relying on them too much might prove problematic at the end of the season.\n\nI'd recommed making your class item arc to have the powerful friends mod. Paired with an arc mod will leave you with 4/5 free points left depending on the chosen mod and masterwork, so you can have either more intellect or recovery almost for free. And have a 42 stats class item instead of the usual 22.\n\nArmour wise the Premium season pass' last pieces have really really high rolls. The warlock ones this season are really well splitted with high recovery and intellect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is pretty much it. Hope you found this post useful. It might seem not that important at first, but getting your super 10 seconds earlier might make a difference in that high intensity Trials match.   \nOr your grenade coming up right before the zone spawns in overtime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a little help that might go a long way, and you could regret not having it :)",
          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something I always notice when I&amp;#39;m inspecting the enemy team in high stakes PvP matches is that not many people pay much attention to their stats and armour perks. It often happens with both teammates and enemy team, so I thought I&amp;#39;d explain how to better optimize your armour sets for PvP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will obviously work for PvE aswell, but you&amp;#39;ll notice the difference way more in PvP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To begin with, I&amp;#39;m Italian, so english isn&amp;#39;t my first language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a console player, Unbroken, and have gone flawless multiple times in the last 3 weeks.&lt;br/&gt;\nI know it&amp;#39;s not a big deal to some, but I&amp;#39;m highly invested into PvP even if I&amp;#39;m not a streamer or someone who does recovs / carries 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;m above average, I end most of my games with a positive KD and in high stakes PvP I focus more on winning the match than on padding my stats.&lt;br/&gt;\nHere are my stats if you&amp;#39;re curious:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/xbl/Pino%20Show/overview\"&gt;https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/xbl/Pino%20Show/overview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to get to the topic of my post: if you open Destiny Item Manager and log in your account you&amp;#39;ll notice that there&amp;#39;s an option called &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/GofCacU\"&gt;Loadout Optimizer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clicking on it will bring you to &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/5GYYYTS\"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. Here you can look through your characters, and DIM will do it&amp;#39;s best to show you the best armour combinations to reach the highest ammount of stats possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This won&amp;#39;t take into account the mods you have on your armour. This is extremely important. You&amp;#39;ll only see the stats that your gear has by default. If an armour piece is masterworked then the +2 to all stats will be counted into the total splits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see my warlock has a set with a T31 split, meaning I have 31 stats point. As in game every 1 point is one level in one of the stats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend to also check the box labelled as Assume Masterworked. This will show you all your best items. It&amp;#39;s especially useful if you need to decide what to masterwork next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not done yet. On the &amp;quot;drag items here to lock&amp;quot; you can select an existing piece of armour to lock, and DIM will show you all the best items to go with it. This is especially useful to build around exotic armour, as you&amp;#39;d probably have better stats splitted legendary armour, meaning many exotics might not show up in your highest tier builds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a loadout selected we can no go to the next step: stat mods!&lt;br/&gt;\nThese are what you&amp;#39;ll use to min max your stats. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some are of course more desirable than others: Recovery, Intellect and Discipline especially.&lt;br/&gt;\nHere&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;ll have to make your choices. What stats do you think are most important to you? What build are you using?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arc web warlocks will want as much discipline as possible.&lt;br/&gt;\nDragon&amp;#39;s shadow hunters will be happy with 50 mobility, so they can spec eerywhere else.&lt;br/&gt;\nA Kepri&amp;#39;s Sting build might want more strength than others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget about the Powerful Friends mod from Season of Dawn for a 20+ mobility when paired with another arc mod (and it&amp;#39;s glitched status ;) ).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that it&amp;#39;s time to focus on the other 2 important aspects: elemental affinity and mods. These go hand in hand and it&amp;#39;s really up to you. Being able to change the element on the armour means that you can now make your best pieces the element you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on your weapon of choice you&amp;#39;ll need to go with an element. General mods usually aren&amp;#39;t worth it that much. I&amp;#39;m saing usually becasue there&amp;#39;s one that&amp;#39;s better than all of them in my opinion: Special Weapon Scavenger. This is a boots mod that allows you to keep the same pair of boots regardless of special weapon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a 4 cost mod though, meaning that if you also are addicted to Traction (like me), you will be pidgeon holed in a 3 cost mod for your boots, &lt;em&gt;and that&amp;#39;s only if you masterwork them!&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that targeting mods on helmets, reload on gauntlets and unflinching on chest are what you&amp;#39;ll be looking for after. Remember to take a look at the seasonal mods aswell, since they&amp;#39;re tipeless and usually cost less than their normal counterparts. Though relying on them too much might prove problematic at the end of the season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommed making your class item arc to have the powerful friends mod. Paired with an arc mod will leave you with 4/5 free points left depending on the chosen mod and masterwork, so you can have either more intellect or recovery almost for free. And have a 42 stats class item instead of the usual 22.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Armour wise the Premium season pass&amp;#39; last pieces have really really high rolls. The warlock ones this season are really well splitted with high recovery and intellect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much it.

I'm sorry but it's SO FRUSTRATING to see Bungie ignore great suggestions/feedback. Could Bungie at least tell us why you're not going to do something if you're not going to do it? Of course Bungie is not forced to answer why they aren't doing something, but when the state of the game is what it is right now and the community is giving good suggestions to the problems we have I feel like we could use at least an explanation? At least tell us why the issues exist and what you're going to do about them?\n\nBungie's actions have made me lose almost all respect for the company and I used to love them (Halo is my favorite franchise of all time). To me it feels like they don't want to do anything that doesn't bring in straight revenue and fast. A couple examples: Pit of Heresy had the death bug where you could die randomly while transitioning from one encounter to another and it took almost 6 months to fix that. Last season the EDZ obelisk was bugged for at least 1,5 months before it was fixed, you couldn't access it without loading to the area again and again. Once it took me 10+ tries before it worked. It seems like they don't either have enough people to playtest, or they don't have enough people to fix the issues, or they just don't care that they're pushing BROKEN TIME LIMITED CONTENT and just broken content out to their players. This season 2/3 of the new exotics are now disabled because they're bugged. Honestly, what is going on Bungie?\n\nThis season's content drops feels like the absolute bare minimum. Last and this season there seems to be more and more problems and things being broken. To me and to many others it seems and feels like Bungie is using D2 as a cash cow while they develop something else. This game and franchise has so much potential but Bungie seems to refuse to let the game live up to its potential. How more many years do we need to wait until this franchise reaches that potential?\n\nBefore I'm being called entitled and whatnot I ask you to hear me out. I'm not saying that Bungie needs to do something I'm saying, I'm not trying to decide anything for them. I don't claim to know better than Bungie, I'm not saying that what I say is the absolute truth. **I'm simply saying how Bungie's actions seem to me and how they make me feel**. The state of the game isn't good right now and my trust in Bungie's ability to fix it is not great. The biggest reasons for all of this are the lack of transparency and communication on many topics. \n\nI'm sorry for the rant and the negativity but I love this game so damn much, though at the same time this is the most frustrating game I've ever played. Not because of difficulty or game mechanics, but because its developer seems to not care about the state of their own game. Maybe I should start caring less.",

          "selftext": "There has been a lot of discussion about Trials of Osiris and the accessibility of its various rewards.  Anecdotally, players on this subreddit seem to have had particular difficulty with getting to 3 wins, with last week (Week 2) seeming particularly difficult for a lot of players.  Since I'm bored and under a stay-at-home order, I figured I would see what the data bore out on Trials.  Here are some results, with preliminary conclusions, to follow.  TLDR:  Skip to the Conclusion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst off, lets take a look at how many players are getting at least 1 Win, 3 wins, or going Flawless over the past Two Weeks.  I pulled data from Braytech, Light.gg and Charlemagne.  Note that the first two pull from a smaller pool of registered users while Charlemagne pulls from all users (aside from a very, very small percentage of players that opt out of having their data tracked.)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n||1 Win (Lifetime)|3 Wins (Lifetime)|Flawless (Lifetime)|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|\n||Source: Lore Book - Chapter 1: Instigate|Source: Hardened by Trial Emblem|Source: Flawless Emblem/s|\n|Braytech|36.34%|28.33%|13.55%|\n|Light.gg|37.32%|28.14%|11.60%|\n|Charlemagne|0.913%|0.741%|0.269%|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, first off we have some fairly obvious conclusions.  Braytech and Light.gg present a subset of players that are much more likely to participate in trials, while the very vast majority of players that have played have never won a match (or probably never even played trials.)  This is unsurprising since D2 is F2P and millions of players have been recorded over its 2+ years of existence.  Most of them are waiting for RNG to make the Taken Blight Heroic instead of sweating in Trials (and we love them for it.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nStill, only around 36-37% of players recorded by Light.gg and/or Braytech have ever won a match.  Lets take this universe of players, however, and assume for a moment that it can represent a set of players that have at least some success in trials.  What is the furthest extent this subset of players go into their cards?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n||Of All Recorded Players with 1+ Win(s)| | |\n:--|--:|--:|:--|\n||% with 3 Win Emblem|% with Flawless Emblem||\n|||||\n|Braytech|77.96%|37.29%||\n|Light.gg|75.40%|31.08%||\n|Charlemagne|81.16%|29.46%||\n\nHere we see that, over the lifetime of ToO so far, players that are able/willing to get a Win in ToO are likely to get a three-win card at some point.  The chances of going flawless, however, are not so great.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo that does it for lifetime numbers that are easily tracked by emblems.  We see that players are either not playing or struggle to get a single win, but if they are playing/able and get a win they are very likely to get 3 wins (~78.2%.)  A substantial minority of players (~21.8) are unable to get to 3 wins after playing trials and scoring at least 1 win.  An even greater percentage of players will not go Flawless, despite clearing the 1-win mark (~67.39.)  This makes a certain amount of sense as the number of players who are engaged with ToO and/or winning decreases the further along we get into different tiers of rewards.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe remaining issue is that of \"skill creep,\" particularly with reports of players being increasingly unable to get even a single kill or 3 win card last week.  This was particularly noticeable for players as the reward for 3-wins was hyped up by content creators as the best shotgun in the game (more or less.)  So lets see how players fared from week to week. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|% of Players with 3-Win Reward for Each Week|Week 1 - The Scholar|Week 2 - Astral Horizon|Week 2/Week 1||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|Braytech|22.95%|22.06%|96.12%|-3.88%|\n|Light.gg|23.46%|15.62%|66.58%|-33.42%|\n|Charlemagne|0.519%|0.529%|101.93%|1.93%|\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere we see our first big divergence between sources.  Braytech and Charlemagne show a slight decrease and slight increase in week-to-week 3-win rewards respectively.   Light.gg, however, shows a nearly 1/3 decrease in players getting the Week 2 reward compared to the Week 1 reward.  Still, Charlemagne shows that MORE players received the Week 2 reward than the Week 1 reward (and Charlemagne counts everyone.)  This could be because the Week 2 reward was more desirable, though it also came during a week where many players did not receive rewards due to issues with Trials resetting.  So: who knows why but more folks got it in total.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMore likely, the issue comes down to a subset of players running into more difficulties than the broader population which Light.gg somehow captures and which we see show up on this subreddit in the form of anecdotes. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nConclusion:\nPlayers of all types  are finding difficulty getting wins, though those that have managed to squeak out a win at least once have managed to get a 3-win reward at some point.  A subset of players that Light.gg captured (though Braytech did not) experienced either substantially more difficulty getting a Week 2 reward than a Week 1 reward or just didn't play as much during Week 2.  Either way, I see from the data that substantial portions of players are able to find success to some degree, though we might see increasing difficulty for certain players as player habits change.  Whether this is suggestive of early-onset skill creep in ToO will require a bit more data to suss out.  Charlemagne tracks real-time, and I'm currently compiling some results but this post is more than long enough as it is. Please let me know if any errors exist in my data or there are any other context/conclusions you have to add.",

Note that the first two pull from a smaller pool of registered users while Charlemagne pulls from all users (aside from a very, very small percentage of players that opt out of having their data tracked.)&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;1 Win (Lifetime)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;3 Wins (Lifetime)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;Flawless (Lifetime)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;Source: Lore Book - Chapter 1: Instigate&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;Source: Hardened by Trial Emblem&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;Source: Flawless Emblem/s&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Braytech&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;36.34%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;28.33%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;13.55%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Light.gg&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;37.32%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;28.14%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;11.60%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;0.913%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;0.741%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;0.269%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, first off we have some fairly obvious conclusions.  Braytech and Light.gg present a subset of players that are much more likely to participate in trials, while the very vast majority of players that have played have never won a match (or probably never even played trials.)  This is unsurprising since D2 is F2P and millions of players have been recorded over its 2+ years of existence.  Most of them are waiting for RNG to make the Taken Blight Heroic instead of sweating in Trials (and we love them for it.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, only around 36-37% of players recorded by Light.gg and/or Braytech have ever won a match.  Lets take this universe of players, however, and assume for a moment that it can represent a set of players that have at least some success in trials.  What is the furthest extent this subset of players go into their cards?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;Of All Recorded Players with 1+ Win(s)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;% with 3 Win Emblem&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;% with Flawless Emblem&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Braytech&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;77.96%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;37.29%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Light.gg&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;75.40%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;31.08%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;81.16%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;29.46%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we see that, over the lifetime of ToO so far, players that are able/willing to get a Win in ToO are likely to get a three-win card at some point.  The chances of going flawless, however, are not so great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that does it for lifetime numbers that are easily tracked by emblems.  We see that players are either not playing or struggle to get a single win, but if they are playing/able and get a win they are very likely to get 3 wins (~78.2%.)  A substantial minority of players (~21.8) are unable to get to 3 wins after playing trials and scoring at least 1 win.  An even greater percentage of players will not go Flawless, despite clearing the 1-win mark (~67.39.)  This makes a certain amount of sense as the number of players who are engaged with ToO and/or winning decreases the further along we get into different tiers of rewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The remaining issue is that of &amp;quot;skill creep,&amp;quot; particularly with reports of players being increasingly unable to get even a single kill or 3 win card last week.  This was particularly noticeable for players as the reward for 3-wins was hyped up by content creators as the best shotgun in the game (more or less.)  So lets see how players fared from week to week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;% of Players with 3-Win Reward for Each Week&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;Week 1 - The Scholar&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;Week 2 - Astral Horizon&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;Week 2/Week 1&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Braytech&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;22.95%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;22.06%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;96.12%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;-3.88%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Light.gg&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;23.46%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;15.62%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;66.58%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;-33.42%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;0.519%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;0.529%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;101.93%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;1.93%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we see our first big divergence between sources.  Braytech and Charlemagne show a slight decrease and slight increase in week-to-week 3-win rewards respectively.   Light.gg, however, shows a nearly 1/3 decrease in players getting the Week 2 reward compared to the Week 1 reward.  Still, Charlemagne shows that MORE players received the Week 2 reward than the Week 1 reward (and Charlemagne counts everyone.)  This could be because the Week 2 reward was more desirable, though it also came during a week where many players did not receive rewards due to issues with Trials resetting.  So: who knows why but more folks got it in total.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More likely, the issue comes down to a subset of players running into more difficulties than the broader population which Light.gg somehow captures and which we see show up on this subreddit in the form of anecdotes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:\nPlayers of all types  are finding difficulty getting wins, though those that have managed to squeak out a win at least once have managed to get a 3-win reward at some point.  A subset of players that Light.gg captured (though Braytech did not) experienced either substantially more difficulty getting a Week 2 reward than a Week 1 reward or just didn&amp;#39;t play as much during Week 2.  Either way, I see from the data that substantial portions of players are able to find success to some degree, though we might see increasing difficulty for certain players as player habits change.  Whether this is suggestive of early-onset skill creep in ToO will require a bit more data to suss out.  Charlemagne tracks real-time, and I&amp;#39;m currently compiling some results but this post is more than long enough as it is. Please let me know if any errors exist in my data or there are any other context/conclusions you have to add.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

You even put it in your tips during the loading screens that bounties are the best source of xp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to like this game, I want to be excited to play, but for a supposedly evolving game, I feel like all it&amp;#39;s been doing is regressing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - I love this game and it means a lot to me, but am I even playing the same game that I got attached to anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
